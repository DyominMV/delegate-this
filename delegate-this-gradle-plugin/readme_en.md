# delegate-this-gradle-plugin

This plugin contains and connects tasks for modifying the bytecode of classes in kotlin so that the trick with
[delegate-this](../delegate-this/readme_en.md) works.

For examples of connecting the plugin, see [example-1](../gradle-example/build.gradle.kts) and
[example-2](../gradle-example-2/build.gradle.kts)
